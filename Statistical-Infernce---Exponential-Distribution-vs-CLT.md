1. Overview
===========

This assignment evaluates the exponential distribution versus Central
Limit Theorem. We will use rexp function to do the simulation. The
values used in this asignment are lambda= 0.2 and
numberofsimulation=1000. We are going to do simulation, comparing sample
mean vs theoritical mean, comparing sample variance versus theoritical
variance and its distribution.

2. Simulation
=============

The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda)
where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution
is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda =
0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of
averages of 40 exponentials. We will do 1000 simulation.

    data_sample <- data.frame(matrix(rexp(n*B, lambda), nrow = B, ncol = n))
    data_sample <- data_sample %>% mutate(mean_sample = rowMeans(data_sample)) 

3. Sample Mean VS Theoritical Mean
==================================

Based on theory, the mean for the theoritical data is 1/lambda. Here is
the code:

    theoritical_mean <- 1/lambda
    print(theoritical_mean)

    ## [1] 5

Then we compute the sample mean with data\_sample dataset.

    sample_mean <- mean(data_sample$mean_sample)
    print(sample_mean)

    ## [1] 5.006442

Based on those two codes above, we have got the the theoretical mean =
5, and the sample mean = 5.018281. Those values are very close enough to
each other.

    data_sample %>% ggplot(aes(mean_sample, ..density..)) + 
          geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, position = 'identity', col= 'black', fill='blue') +
          xlab('Sample Mean') + 
          ylab('Density') +
          ggtitle('Distribution of Sample Means') +
          geom_vline(xintercept = theoritical_mean, color='black') +
          geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean, color= 'yellow')

4. Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance
==============================================

Based on theory, the variance for the theoretical data is sd^2/n.Â Here
is the code:

    theoritical_variance <- (1/lambda)^2/n
    print(theoritical_variance)

    ## [1] 0.625

Then we compute the sample variance using data\_sample dataset that we
have been created.

    sample_variance <- var(data_sample$mean_sample)
    print(sample_variance)

    ## [1] 0.5908158

Based on those two codes above, we have got the theoretical variance =
0.625, and the sample variance = 0.636219

5. Distribution
===============

Based on Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the sample mean
should follow this theorem. We will see the density plot here

    data_sample %>% ggplot(aes(mean_sample, ..density..)) + 
          geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, position = 'identity', col= 'black', fill='blue') +
          xlab('Sample Mean') + 
          ylab('Density') +
          ggtitle('Distribution of Sample Means') +
          geom_vline(xintercept = theoritical_mean, color='black') +
          geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean, color= 'yellow') +
          geom_density(colour='darkgreen', size=1)

To give more evidence that the distribution sample mean occurs in
Central Limit Theorem, we use qq plot function.

    mean_sample <- data_sample$mean_sample
    qqnorm(mean_sample, main='Normal qq plot');qqline(mean_sample, col='3')

![](Statistical-Infernce---Exponential-Distribution-vs-CLT_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)
This QQ plot show a close relationship between the data sample mean and
the theoritical mean. Thats why we can say that Our simulation is
approximately a normal distribution.
